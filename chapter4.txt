From that day on, Sammy was known as the bravest little squirrel in the forest. He showed everyone that even the smallest creatures can do great things with a big heart and a little courage.

The forest was never the same. Sammy's bravery inspired all the animals to help each other and work together, no matter their size. And as for Sammy, he continued to explore and collect acorns, always ready to lend a helping hand (or paw) to anyone in need.

And so, the forest thrived, full of friendship, bravery, and endless adventures.
